New Mirror Project in Ganymede orbit
From: Jovian Progress and Peoples Council, 10/3/2224 SST.
Jovian System
A new mega project is being built in orbit of IO. This project is meant to alter the local day length.
The mirror is also meant to warm the surface to a more bearable temperature in preparation for larger
terraforming projects. Our largest moon will soon be provided with adequate power to run large refineries
making Ganymede the core of the settled system's manufacturing capabilities. This is only our first step
towards greatness for the Jovian system, more projects on the way. Гарного вам дня

Work on the Moon; What you need to know
From The Luna Post, Shackleton, 10/2/2224 SST
Terran System
The Moon is the fastest growing sector in the settled systems, good work being the primary reason for that.
The Space Docks all throughout the Terran system consume the vast majority of our mined and manufactured materials.
To power The Terran military we must mine, and process more! The Democratic United System is providing pools of
YenDollars to anyone who wants to move to The Moon and start your own company or work for the big three,
Southern NewPeru Mining, Saudi Refco, and Yamato Tritium. The big three are great employers with high wages and
safe work conditions compared to IO and Belt mining and refining. If your more into manufacturing then Hanwha Space
provides great vessel construction in Lunar orbit. They produce 40% of all the ships in the Terran system and 20% in all
the settled systems. If you want to help our great military, then Lockheed X Martin could be your best bet. You can commute
from The Moon to GEO every month or so. Its a little distant, but it makes the best money on luna except for Yamato Tritium atomic
engineers. Overall, there are many opportunities on The Moon in the Terran System so join us pushing the DUS forward!
