Belt sector AP-089 daily updates
Jimle Brown, news officer of AP-089, 10/10/2224 SST
Belt Sector AP-089
Hello everyone out there in AP-089! hope your solar days have been full of profitable mining ventures!
I heard Tom had his most profitable solar year, with the recent uptick of mega projects under construction
across the settled systems it makes sense that our products would become more valuable. So everyone, you too Sarah,
can look forward to increased prices at the carrier fleets. Now for our monthly updates price jumps to watch out for.
-> Iron 10.78/T > 11.05
-> Water 104.77/T > 160.01
-> Gold 30.89/T > 30.10
-> Generals 2.05 > 2.06
Prices rise, and not just mining products, we have a lot of new neighbors outside our little sector.
Chi from AP-090 told me that 5 new miners joined the sector just over this past solar month! We could see
an increase to our population from 10 to ... maybe 11!
That's all for today's updates! Stay calm and keep mining!

Mining asteroids? Try comets instead!

Hey there all you 10 or so out there listening to me on the void today. I want to talk about an alternative mining source.
We mine rocks, dusty rocks and dust all day every day, and that has done us well, but there is another resource
that we have seen an increase in price, to most of our dismays... WATER! By ton water has increased from 104.77 to 160.01 YenDollars
in the past solar month! That is a massive increase, but we all know that especially when the carriers come by they try to sell us
it at an even higher price! Well, I have a solution for you, our sector has a varying amount of comets or icy asteroids, around 400-500
at any given time. I started mining these resources and I have never been happier! I am swindling the carriers now! I just sold a couple tons of
H2O for 170.01 YenDollars.
I hope to see you farming that ice, see you next time!

---WARNING--- carriers will be taking a vacation this next week for Victory Week, celebrating the victory we share during
the Great Solar War. We hope that you take a break as well and appreciate what we have built together.
After Victory Week the guild will have a couple more ships in the AP-08* systems providing more opportunity to sell your product.
