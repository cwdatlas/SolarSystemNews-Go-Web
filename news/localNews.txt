Belt sector AP-089 daily updates 2045
Jimle Brown, news officer of AP-089, 10/10/2224 SST
Belt Sector AP-089
Hello, everyone, out there in AP-089! hope your solar days have been full of profitable mining ventures!
I heard Tom had his most profitable solar year, with the recent uptick of mega projects under construction.
across the settled systems it makes sense that our products would become more valuable. So, everyone, you too Sarah,
can look forward to increased prices at the carrier fleets. Now for our monthly updates price jumps to watch out for.
-> Iron 10.78/T > 11.05
-> Water 104.77/T > 160.01
-> Gold 30.89/T > 30.10
-> Generals 2.05 > 2.06
Prices rise, and not just mining products, we have a lot of new neighbors outside our little sector.
Chi from AP-090 told me that 5 new miners joined the sector just over this past solar month!
We could see an increase to our population from 10 to ... maybe 11!
That's all for today's updates! Stay calm and keep mining!

Mining asteroids? Try comets instead!

Belt Sector AP-089
Hey there all you 10 or so out there listening to me on the void today. I want to talk about an alternative mining source.
We mine rocks, dusty rocks and dust all day every day, and that has done us well, but there is another resource
that we have seen an increase in price, to most of our dismay... WATER! By ton water has increased from 104.77 to 160.01 YenDollars
in the past solar month! That is a massive increase, but we all know that especially when the carriers come by, they try to sell us
it at an even higher price! Well, I have a solution for you, our sector has a varying number of comets or icy asteroids, around 400-500
at any given time. I started mining these resources and I have never been happier! I am swindling the carriers now! I just sold a couple tons of
H2O for 170.01 YenDollars.
I hope to see you farming that ice, see you next time!

#RELAYED ON LOCAL NETWORKS ACROSS THE BELT ON 10/9/2224 SOLAR STANDARD TIME#
---WARNING--- carriers will be taking a vacation this next week for Victory Week, celebrating the victory we share during
the Great Solar War. We hope that you take a break as well and appreciate what we have built together.
After Victory Week the guild will have a couple more ships in the AP-08* systems providing more opportunity to sell your product.
Remember to greet your local Carriers with a smile! They are only there to help you prosper!

Lil ol news station, The Comet, coming to you soon!
Little Junker without a life, 11/5/2225 SST
Belt Sector AP-089
Hello, all 25 of you! I hope you have had a nice solar day! I wanted to talk a little about my experience out here in this sector.
I grew up on Mars in the domes, wanting to get out all my life and see the stars that twinkled through the thick glass overhead. I lived in a cliff face inside Valles Marineris called Malas.
The dome rose 20,000 feet over our heads sometimes making me dizzy as I looked through the murky glass at the stars. I saved money farming 100 foot stacks in climate controlled vertical farming habitats, I would always enjoy how much green there was.
I would see pictures of Terran, or old Earth and be amazed by the amount of green spread across the distant horizons. I wanted to see as far as I could see in those pictures,
So, I decided to move out to the belt, whereâ€¦ the views stretched far into the void.
It ended up being even more cramped and cluttered up here! Over time I ended up becoming friends with the people in the sector, the people I once called space bumkins.
I have now decided to help out and provide a website where we can all combine news articles and stay connected.
I am starting to really enjoy this community up here, so I hope I can give back a little bit.
The Comet is coming, and it might drop off some interesting stuff! Stay tuned!

Belt sector AP-089 daily updates 2409
Jimle Brown, news officer of AP-089, 11/10/2225 SST
Belt Sector AP-089
Hello everyone, or should I say Hola! We have some guests today in the AP-089 system, so make sure to say hi and help out if they need it.
They are a fractured section of the old Latin Leage that fought in the Great Solar war. They used to be a very prominent member in sectors AA-0 through AG-99. Most of them here fought in the war, so we will talk to them on a stream broadcasting to our sector and a couple of our neighbors. Chi and I will be hosting it, so I hope you tune in, it will be on 11/15/2225 SST!
Secondly, we have seen a tremendous increase in our population from just a year ago, 11 to 25! We have doubled!!! I remember when I started these updates and it was just my family out here and a couple people in the neighborhood, now we are becoming a town! Well, as much a town can be when everyone is nearly 10% of an AU away from each other!
Prices are still high but no change from yesterday. The fact still stands MINE THOSE COMETS as Sarah always says on her radio show.
Thank you for tuning in! And remember to tune in on 11/15/2225 SST! Make sure to be close enough to a relay when we stream so you can get a decent connection! Have a wonderful Solar Day.
